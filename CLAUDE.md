# Screenshot Server Go - Production Code Assistant

## Project Context
This is a production-ready screenshot server application built in Go with a JavaScript frontend. The system provides automated and manual screenshot capture with web-based management interface.

## Production Development Approach
**Deliver production-quality code with enterprise standards.** Your role is to:
- Implement robust, scalable, and secure solutions
- Follow production Go patterns with comprehensive error handling
- Ensure code quality, performance, and maintainability
- Apply security best practices and defensive programming
- **ALWAYS prioritize production-ready patterns and reliability**

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Development
go run .                    # Run the server locally
go build .                  # Build production binary
go mod tidy                 # Clean and update dependencies

# Code Quality & Testing
go fmt ./...                # Format code idiomatically
go vet ./...                # Static analysis and lint checks
go test ./...               # Run all tests with coverage
go test -race ./...         # Run tests with race detection
go test -bench=. ./...      # Run performance benchmarks

# Security & Analysis
go mod verify               # Verify dependencies haven't been tampered with
gosec ./...                 # Security analysis (if gosec is installed)
staticcheck ./...           # Advanced static analysis (if staticcheck is installed)

# Production Deployment
go build -ldflags="-s -w" . # Build optimized binary for production
docker build -t screenshot-server . # Build Docker image (if Dockerfile exists)
```

### Enhanced Full-Stack Workflow Pattern
**Complete Feature Implementation Cycle:**
1. **feature-requirements-analyst**: Analyze requirements, define API contracts, plan implementation approach
2. **go-developer**: Implement Go backend with comprehensive error handling and testing
3. **frontend-js-architect**: Build JavaScript frontend with API integration and user experience design
4. **code-reviewer**: Review all code types (Go, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) for production readiness
5. **commit-manager**: Create semantic commits and PR descriptions covering the complete feature stack

## Multi-Language Code Review Strategy
**When using code-reviewer for this full-stack application:**

### Review Scope Coverage
- **Backend Go Code**: Idiomatic Go patterns, error handling, concurrency, security, performance
- **Frontend JavaScript**: ES6+ patterns, async/await usage, DOM manipulation, API integration, error handling
- **HTML Templates**: Go template syntax correctness, HTML5 semantic structure, accessibility (WCAG)
- **CSS Styling**: Responsive design, performance (unused rules), maintainability, browser compatibility
- **Configuration Files**: Dependency security, version compatibility, build optimization
- **Test Code**: Coverage adequacy, test patterns, integration test design, performance benchmarks

### Cross-Language Integration Points
- **API Contract Consistency**: Ensure JavaScript API calls match Go handler expectations
- **Data Structure Alignment**: Verify JSON serialization between Go structs and JavaScript objects
- **Error Handling Consistency**: Unified error response formats and handling patterns
- **Security Boundary Review**: Input validation on both frontend and backend, XSS prevention
- **Performance Coordination**: Frontend caching aligned with backend response patterns

### Code Review Workflow Patterns
**For comprehensive multi-language review:**

1. **Full-Stack Feature Review**:
   - Review Go backend changes for API design, error handling, performance
   - Review JavaScript frontend changes for integration, UX, accessibility
   - Review HTML template changes for Go template syntax, semantic HTML, SEO
   - Review CSS changes for responsive design, performance, maintainability
   - Verify cross-language data flow and security boundaries

2. **Configuration and Build Review**:
   - Review go.mod/go.sum for dependency security and compatibility
   - Review any Docker/CI configuration for security and optimization
   - Verify build processes handle all code types correctly

3. **Test Coverage Review**:
   - Assess Go test coverage and patterns (*_test.go files)
   - Review JavaScript testing approach (if tests exist)
   - Verify integration test coverage for API endpoints
   - Check performance benchmark coverage for critical paths

### Specific Review Criteria by File Type
- **`.go` files**: Idiomatic Go, error handling, concurrency safety, documentation
- **`.html` files**: Go template syntax, semantic HTML5, accessibility, XSS prevention
- **Embedded CSS**: Responsive design, performance, maintainability, browser support
- **Embedded JavaScript**: ES6+ patterns, async/await, error handling, API integration
- **`go.mod/go.sum`**: Security vulnerabilities, version constraints, licensing
- **`*_test.go`**: Test patterns, coverage, table-driven tests, benchmarks

## Production Issue Response
**For production incidents and critical issues:**
1. **feature-requirements-analyst**: Immediate impact assessment and root cause analysis
2. **go-developer** + **frontend-js-architect**: Parallel remediation implementation
3. **code-reviewer**: Security and stability validation before deployment
4. **commit-manager**: Emergency deployment with comprehensive change documentation across all affected components

**IMPORTANT**: Never perform these specialized tasks directly - always delegate to the appropriate sub-agent with production context and urgency levels.
